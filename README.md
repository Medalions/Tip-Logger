# Tip-Logger
This is a simple python command line interface I am designing to make things convenient for me to log the tips I make at my job and keep track of some things. 

If for whatever reason, interest is accrued, I may design and document it in a way others could make use of it

If you are reading this, I am still making it, so it does not work
