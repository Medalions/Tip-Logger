# Tip-Logger
This is a simple python command line interface I am designing to make things convenient for me to log the tips I make at my job and keep track of some things. 

If for whatever reason, interest is accrued, I may design and document it in a way others could make use of it

It has not yet been thoroughly tested yet, but as of now it should be fully functional. However, it has a good set of things that 
are hardcoded for my specific circumstances, so if you want to make use of it, let me know and I can make some adjustments, or you could
edit the files yourself (it is just a few python scripts)
